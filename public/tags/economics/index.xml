      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my notes, made after reading each book (here referred to as a chapter) and the sections contained within those books. These notes are not intended to replace reading the book, which is essential for a better understanding of the concepts, but rather aim to help readers review and complement their reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes have been supplemented with my own observations and ideas. As the bookâ€™s author himself suggested, some sections and books are intended for a non-lay audience; such sections and books were skipped in these notes, which are primarily aimed at the lay reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
