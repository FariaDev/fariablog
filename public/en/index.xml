&lt;p&gt;Here are my notes, made after reading each book (here referred to as a chapter) and the sections contained within those books. These notes are not intended to replace reading the book, which is essential for a better understanding of the concepts, but rather aim to help readers review and complement their reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes have been supplemented with my own observations and ideas. As the book’s author himself suggested, some sections and books are intended for a non-lay audience; such sections and books were skipped in these notes, which are primarily aimed at the lay reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I began studying Latin using &lt;em&gt;Napoleão Mendes de Almeida’s Latin Grammar&lt;/em&gt;. Upon reading the preface of the work, I was captivated by the author’s opinions and justifications for studying Latin, and I decided to compare them to the study of other subjects and education in general, as we share similar views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this text in a slightly different style than I’m accustomed to, as my goal here was to complement what I read and share this valuable knowledge with readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Are We Always Tired: Han&#39;s Diagnosis</title>

&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you felt exhausted? It was probably recently, and it likely wasn’t just a one-time occurrence in the past few weeks. If you stop to observe, we’re all like this. This doesn’t seem like a healthy kind of tiredness, the kind that a weekend of rest can fix, but rather an “infinite tiredness.” You try to rest, but you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the South Korean philosopher and cultural theorist Byung-Chul Han attempted to unravel the origins of this chronic fatigue in his work &lt;em&gt;The Burnout Society&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll use it as the basis for this article, but I’ll also try to add some concepts and insights I gained while reading his book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Parallel Between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky</title>

&lt;p&gt;Is reason truly superior to emotion? Should we always prioritize reason? Many philosophers and writers have debated these questions, but today we will focus specifically on the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) and the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881), through their works &lt;em&gt;Twilight of the Idols&lt;/em&gt; (Nietzsche) and &lt;em&gt;Notes from Underground&lt;/em&gt; (Dostoevsky). Before diving into the works themselves, I feel obliged to provide a brief introduction to each author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friedrich-nietzsche-18441900&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, Nietzsche challenged traditional morality, declared the “death of God,” and advocated for the creation of new values through the will to power. The goal here is not to provide a biography of him, so I will focus only on why we should study him and what he meant by his famous phrase “God is dead.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Reading Any Book Better Than Reading None?</title>

&lt;p&gt;For some time now, I’ve noticed a growing wave of digital influencers focused on reading and books in general. Typically, the books they read and recommend are popular, easily digestible works that lack depth of content, or what some call “fast-food” literature. But is reading these books alone enough? Is reading any book better than reading none? Well, let’s try to find answers to these questions using a field of study that’s gaining popularity every day: neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
