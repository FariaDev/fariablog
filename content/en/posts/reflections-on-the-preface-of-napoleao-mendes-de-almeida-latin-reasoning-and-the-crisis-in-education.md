<!-- # Reflections on Napoleão Mendes de Almeida’s Preface: Latin, Reasoning, and the Crisis in Education -->

---
A few days ago, I began studying Latin using *Napoleão Mendes de Almeida’s Latin Grammar*. Upon reading the preface of the work, I was captivated by the author’s opinions and justifications for studying Latin, and I decided to compare them to the study of other subjects and education in general, as we share similar views.

I wrote this text in a slightly different style than I’m accustomed to, as my goal here was to complement what I read and share this valuable knowledge with readers.

He begins by discussing three internationally renowned mathematicians who visited Brazil.

## 1. The Mathematicians’ Observation: Memorization vs. Reasoning
>“Upon arriving in Brazil, we were amazed by the vast array of memorized mathematical formulas with which Brazilian students complete secondary education—formulas that in Italy—the three professors were chairs at different Italian faculties—are taught only in the second year of university. However, we were shocked by the poverty of reasoning, the lack of logical deduction among Brazilian students. We ask Your Excellency that, in the planned reform, less mathematics and MORE LATIN be included in secondary education, so that we can teach mathematics at the university level.”

This observation about the poverty of reasoning among Brazilian students was also made by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman in his work *Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!*:

>"After much investigation, I discovered that the students had memorized everything, but they didn’t know what it meant."

He also highlighted the lack of interaction and discussion among students, which hindered collaborative learning and deep understanding, giving way to superficial “memorization.”

## 2. The Latin-Mathematics Connection and Interdisciplinarity
>“2 — Professor Albanese used to say—and many people are proof of this—‘Give me a good Latin student, and I will make them a great mathematician.’”

Here is another quote that underscores the importance of interdisciplinarity.

I believe that nowadays, we’ve reached a high level of specialization, no longer producing polymaths as in the past. Today, we produce highly intelligent individuals in extremely specific subjects. I think this is due to the compartmentalization of disciplines in universities, where you focus on a single subject throughout your master’s, doctorate, etc., without room for other equally important disciplines that are not directly related to your field of study.

## 3. The Myth of Latin’s Absence in the U.S. and Political Influence
>“4 — It is also entirely false for educators—so-called because, amidst political struggles and ambitions, they held education portfolios or, at most, wrote books on child psychology—to say—these words were spoken at a session of the ‘guidelines and bases of education’ commission, appointed to fulfill article 5, item XV, d, of the federal constitution—‘in the United States of America, a country no one denies is at the forefront of progress, Latin is not studied.’
>
>Fortunately, at that same meeting, the misguided claim did not go unanswered; one of the commission members was quick to respond: ‘What do you mean it’s not studied? It’s easy to prove; let’s request programs from various American institutions—various, because secondary education programming there is not uniform as in Brazil—and we’ll see the truth.’ Days and days passed, and no programs arrived; when questioned, the ‘educator’ replied that they hadn’t arrived. One day, however—whether due to someone’s oversight—the Latin advocate examined an open, forgotten drawer and found the requested programs, hidden or stored away, and in all of them, Latin was rigorously required.
>
>That ‘educator’ was, at the time… president of a state section of a political party.”

Here, we see how much our education is modeled after the American system, which John Taylor Gatto, a renowned New York teacher, proved in his book *Dumbing Us Down* to be flawed and riddled with serious errors, clearly observable in Brazilian education as well.

I will write an article specifically on this topic in the future.

## 4. Latin, Intellectual Development, and Student Distraction
>“5 — The poor Brazilian student finds no one to prove that Latin, among all disciplines, is the one that most fosters intellectual development. Perhaps they don’t even understand the meaning of ‘developing intelligence,’ such is the crudeness of their mind, preoccupied with things other than studies.
>
>The habit of analysis, the spirit of observation, the education of reasoning—we, poor teachers, can hardly achieve this in a student solely concerned with grades, vacations, balls, and magazines.”

Here, we see another point I often discuss: students’ preoccupation with things other than studies and the death of intellectualism ingrained in today’s world. I’m not saying students should only think about studies; they **must** engage in other activities besides studying, as these are also fundamental for intellectual excellence. However, these should not take the place of study. It’s important that study is neither neglected nor overshadowed by any of these other activities, such as magazines, balls, cell phones, and the overrated grades.

Students focus solely on grades because, with them, they obtain a “certificate” that they supposedly “understood” a subject and no longer need to study it. Their purpose in studying is to achieve good grades, not full understanding. I touched on this a bit in my most recent article on the burnout society, where this culture of valuing quantitative results is preached by performance subjects.

## 5. Educating vs. Teaching: The Role of the Teacher
>“There are many people, unaware of educational matters, who are surprised to see Latin advocated in secondary education, hardly knowing that teaching is not acting, and educating is not teaching. Teaching is giving the student independence of thought, enabling them to progress on their own: the teacher is a guide. Educating is instilling in the student the spirit of analysis, observation, and reasoning, enabling them to go beyond the mere letter of the text, the mere content of a book, encouraging and inspiring them. The educational work of the teacher lies in turning today’s student into tomorrow’s citizen.”

I don’t think I need to say anything about this quote; it is excellent on its own and addresses the teacher’s role and the definition of educating.

## 6. The Purpose of Study: Beyond Superficial Culture
>“Being cultured is not knowing various languages. Knowledge of English or French does not prove an individual’s culture. There are many sailors, peddlers, and gypsies for whom half a dozen languages are familiar, yet they possess no culture.
>
>Latin is not studied to be spoken. It is studied to sharpen the intellect, to become more observant, to improve the power of mental concentration, to compel attention, to develop the spirit of analysis, to accustom oneself to calm and deliberation—qualities indispensable to the scientist. That is why the student studies this language.”

Many wish to study and become intellectuals solely to gain fame and prestige. That is not what study should be for, as the author states in the quote about Latin, which also applies to study in general and what learning should serve. Don’t study to be seen as someone who studies; study to elevate your soul and wisdom to levels never seen before.

## 7. The Shallowness of the Current Generation and the Lack of Thinking Habits
>“7 — Many wonder about the reason for the shallowness, frivolity, and intellectual barrenness of today’s youth. It’s because, having learned to read through the analytical method, so practical and easy, the student believes that a discipline that doesn’t involve practice and ease of learning is of no use, only boredom and a waste of time. Accustomed to assimilating everything easily in primary school, the student stumbles in secondary school with the obligation to think, and they find it strange, they falter, and they rebel. The child who was first in the class in primary school drops to a lower rank in secondary school; a loss of intelligence, a difference in age? No: a lack of the habit of thinking. The student who was fifth or tenth in primary school rises to the top ranks in secondary school; a gain in intelligence? Also no: slower, steadier thinking surpasses colleagues with a livelier intellect, lively only for objective and evident things.
>
>Reasoning is, starting from known, different ideas, arriving at a third, unknown one, and Latin, when studied with method, calm, and deliberation, is the greatest factor in sharpening the student’s reasoning power, making their conclusions clearer and firmer.”

The reason for the shallowness of today’s youth. A spot-on diagnosis, where students think that ease of learning equates to quality of learning. On the contrary, reasoning demands effort, time, and thought.

## 8. Political Ignorance about Education and Culture
>“8 — What is certain, absolutely certain, is that some people who represent us in Congress do not know what education or culture is. A recent incident proves it.”

On the importance of electing good political representatives, or else we can forget hopes for better education.

## 9. The Transformative Effect of Latin (and Study)
>“The question is not what the boys will do with Latin, but what Latin will do for the boys: *The question is not what your boy will do with Latin, but what Latin will do for your boy,* said Senator Arnold with the calm, innate good sense of his people.”

It’s not what students will do with study, but what study will do for the students.

## 10. Avoiding Sterile Erudition
>“‘For us,’ said the eminent educator Father Augusto Magne, ‘what matters in Latin is its literature, its spirit-forming virtue. Diverting the study of Latin to specialization in trivial matters of reconstructed pronunciation is to distort that discipline and strip it of its formative power, falling into pompous, pretentious, and sterile erudition.’”

Finally, we must not divert study to “specialization in trivial matters of pronunciation” or, in other words, superficial things. Do not allow the discipline to be distorted and erudition to become pompous, pretentious, and sterile.
