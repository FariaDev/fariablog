<!-- # **Is Reading Any Book Better Than Reading None?** -->

---
For some time now, I’ve noticed a growing wave of digital influencers focused on reading and books in general. Typically, the books they read and recommend are popular, easily digestible works that lack depth of content, or what some call “fast-food” literature. But is reading these books alone enough? Is reading any book better than reading none? Well, let’s try to find answers to these questions using a field of study that’s gaining popularity every day: neuroscience.

## **General Benefits of Reading**
Virtually any type of reading is sufficient to activate certain brain regions related to language, memory, and even imagination, strengthening neural connections and promoting a mechanism that allows the brain to “self-modify,” known as neuroplasticity (Izquierdo, 2006).

Additionally, a 2018 study (Kourkouta & Vakalopoulou) demonstrated that reading reduces levels of a stress-related hormone, cortisol. Other benefits may include vocabulary expansion (Huettig & Pickering, 2019) and improved sleep—who hasn’t picked up a book to read before bed?—especially when reading physical books, in contrast to the blue light emitted by digital devices (Chang et al., 2015).

## **📚 “Fast-Food” Books**
Popular fiction activates the **default mode network (DMN)**—don’t worry about the technical terms—which is often associated with the mental simulation of others’ experiences, enhancing empathy. MRI studies—imaging exams that produce detailed images of the human body’s interior—show that reading imaginative narratives increases activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region linked to generating alternative scenarios and creativity (Mar et al., 2006).

Moreover, reading light books reduces activity in the cerebral amygdala—a small almond-shaped structure associated with emotional regulation—promoting mental relaxation (Erk et al., 2010).

## **📖 Deep Books and Critical Thinking**
Complex texts, such as classic literature or philosophical works, require integration between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—responsible for analysis—and the inferior frontal gyrus—involved in semantic processing. This brain activity enhances critical thinking and reflective capacity (Kidd & Castano, 2013).

Furthermore, philosophical texts promote the formation of chunks in working memory, reorganizing information into meaningful blocks (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974).

## **🔍 Neurological Differences Between Genres**
Literary fiction activates the superior temporal sulcus, crucial for social inferences and empathy (Mar et al., 2006). On the other hand, nonfiction strengthens the left angular gyrus, associated with the integration of factual information and technical learning (Gabriel et al., 2016). Rapid reading, like that practiced on social media, reduces activation of the ventral temporal cortex, essential for deep comprehension (Wolf, 2018). In contrast, slow reading of classics increases cortical thickness in the occipito-temporal cortex, improving linguistic processing (Dehaene, 2009).

## **⏳ Long-Term Evidence**
Know that friend who’s addicted to reading? Well, now you can tell them that avid readers develop 15% more connections in the brain’s white matter—the tissue that connects different brain regions—creating a “neural savings account” that protects against brain aging (Shafto et al., 2014). Longitudinal studies, such as Wilson et al. (2013), show that elderly people who read weekly have a 32% lower risk of developing dementia.

A recent study published in **Nature Mental Health** (Bartrés-Faz et al., 2024) revealed that adults with a high purpose in reading—such as engaging with philosophy—have a thicker prefrontal cortex, an indicator of brain health.

## **🎯 Conclusion**
In conclusion, the relationship between the content of the books we read and the benefits of reading is complex and multifaceted. For example, reading **“fast-food”** books brings emotional benefits and relaxation, while deep works stimulate critical thinking and long-term brain health, and may also serve as a knowledge base for students preparing for college entrance exams.

So, what’s the answer? Balance. As with almost everything in life, the balance between these two types of reading is the key to maximizing benefits. Neuroscience confirms that:

- Popular novels stimulate the anterior insula, linked to emotions (Erk et al., 2010).
- Complex texts strengthen the anterior cingulate cortex, related to ethical decision-making (Gabriel et al., 2016).

Thus, combining fiction (for empathy) and nonfiction (for analysis) enhances the connectivity of the corpus callosum, integrating the brain’s hemispheres and promoting a healthier, more versatile brain.
